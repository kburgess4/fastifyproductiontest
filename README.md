# Fastify

Fastify is a fast and low-overhead web framework for Node.js, focused on providing an efficient and developer-friendly API. It is designed to be highly performant and scalable, making it a great choice for building high-traffic web applications and APIs.

## Features

- **Fast**: Fastify is built on top of the `http` core module, and it's designed to be as fast as possible.
- **Extensible**: Fastify has a plugin system that allows you to extend the core functionality with third-party plugins.
- **Highly Performant**: Fastify is one of the fastest web frameworks for Node.js, thanks to its efficient routing and serialization mechanisms.
- **Developer Friendly**: Fastify provides a clear and intuitive API, making it easy to get started and build your applications.
- **TypeScript Support**: Fastify has first-class support for TypeScript, allowing you to take advantage of static typing.

## Installation

You can install Fastify using npm:

```
npm install fastify
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of a Fastify server:

```javascript
const fastify = require('fastify')()

fastify.get('/', (request, reply) => {
  reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
})

fastify.listen(3000, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
})
```

This code creates a Fastify server, defines a route for the root URL (`/`), and starts the server on port 3000.
